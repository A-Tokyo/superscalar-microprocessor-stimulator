The master branch should be only left for completely stable commits, and managed via GitHub. (i.e. through pull requests) of course create a branch with your new feature first.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThe goal of this project is to implement an architectural simulator capable of assessing the performance of a simplified superscalar out-‐‐of-‐‐order 16-‐‐bit RISC\r\nprocessor that uses Tomasulo’s algorithm with speculation taking into account the effect of the cache organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n- Tomasulo\r\n    - Tomasulo code exists in the package tomasulo with the class Tomasulo as the bundler\r\n- Functional Units\r\n    - Functional units should be in the package functionalUnits\r\n- Memory Hierarchy\r\n    - Memory Hierarchy code exists in the package memoryHierarchy with the class MemoryHierarchy as the bundler\r\n- Utilitis\r\n    - If you want to add any general function such as mathematical log, or printing a 2D array add them to the Utils class and     import it where you need it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n- Memory Hierarchy (80% completed)\r\n    - Bundle the files together and add cache leveling\r\n- Tomasulo (20% completed)\r\n- Functional Units (0% completed)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\n- Clone the repository  `git clone https://github.com/A-Tokyo/superscalar-microprocessor-stimulator`\r\n- Checkout dev `git checkout dev`\r\n- Create a new branch `git checkout -b branchName` or work on dev (discouraged for conflicts)\r\n- Open eclipse\r\n- Click on File -> Import -> Select General, Existing projects into workspace -> click next\r\n- Select root directory and copy the path to the repository folder or browse for it\r\n- Contribute and send a pull request to dev\r\n- To commit through eclipse, right click on the project, select team, share\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conventions\r\n- Please follow the following naming conventions http://www.javatpoint.com/java-naming-conventions\r\n",
